         <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
   	   <div class="half-width">
           <p>I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out here. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
   	   </div>
   	     <div class="half-width"> <!-- All of this code will create a box with two boxes inside-->
             <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

                Hand-coded HTML
            </h3>
            <p>
                My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

              <p>
                  I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.

                    You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.
